          <p><i><center>“Cyber-Security is much more than a matter of IT.” ― Stephane Nappo</center></i></p>
          <p>Protecting computer systems, devices, and sensitive data from viruses, unwanted access, damage, and data breaches is a key component of cybersecurity work. According to Global Knowledge, a provider of IT professional development services, cybersecurity is one of the two IT domains where demand is anticipated to be highest (the other being cloud computing).</p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <h1><center>Career Path: Roles and Career Progression in Cybersecurity</center></h1>
          <p>Employees in cybersecurity assist businesses from all sectors in enhancing their overall security and preventing or thwarting cyberattacks. This is crucial in the modern, digitalized corporate environment when a single data leak could permanently damage a company's reputation and goodwill.</p>
          <p>Depending on a variety of factors, roles in the cybersecurity field have a wide range of job titles and duties. For instance, based on regulatory and legal responsibilities, various businesses (such as finance and healthcare) would have distinct cybersecurity requirements. But at its essence, cybersecurity is really about avoiding the wrong hands coming into contact with critical data.</p>

            <h1>Here are some cybersecurity roles to consider:</h1>
          </div>

          <div class="def">
            <p><b>1. Ethical Hacker/Penetration Tester</b></p>
            <p>A penetration tester tries to legally hack the cybersecurity systems of a business, which is one of the most fascinating jobs in the cybersecurity industry. Instead of trying to obtain illegal access to enterprise systems, it is done to evaluate how strong the company's security position is. You have the duty to thoroughly test systems in this position to identify cybersecurity flaws.</p>

            <p><b>2. Cybersecurity Analyst</b></p>
            <p>As a cybersecurity analyst, you must concentrate on safeguarding your company's digital assets by examining current cybersecurity methods and regulations. The results of this research assist in addressing vulnerabilities in your company's cybersecurity infrastructure.</p>

            <p><b>3. Cybersecurity Administrator</b></p>
            <p>All of an organization's cybersecurity systems are managed by a cybersecurity administrator. In order to maintain your company operating efficiently and securely, you must be familiar with its whole infrastructure. Additionally, you operate as the team's main point of contact for cybersecurity. Additionally, it is your duty to install, manage, and troubleshoot security solutions as necessary.</p>

            <p><b>4. Incident Response Specialist</b></p>
            <p>Professionals that handle incident response receive in-depth training that prepares them to handle cybersecurity incidents. An incident response expert must respond quickly to a threat, such as a data breach, and work with the team to prevent future incidents of that threat.</p>

            <p><b>5. Cybersecurity Specialist</b></p>
            <p>Protecting your company's software and network security systems is a key aspect of working as a cybersecurity specialist. To do this in the majority of firms, you'll need to take a thorough approach that includes risk analysis, internal and external security audits, security assessments, and vulnerability testing.</p>

            <p><b>6. Cybersecurity Engineer</b></p>
            <p>You must recognize and address typical security flaws if you decide to work as a cybersecurity engineer. Your responsibility is to develop and put into place solutions to close security infrastructure gaps in order to safeguard the endpoints and networks in your company from breaches and similar incidents. You would also be responsible for monitoring and documenting the analysis of multi-vendor cybersecurity solutions.</p>

            <p><b>7. Cybersecurity Auditor</b></p>
            <p>A cybersecurity auditor is tasked with the duty of auditing an organization's cybersecurity systems, as the name suggests. You have a responsibility as an auditor to evaluate cybersecurity system weaknesses and provide solutions.</p>

            <p><b>8. Forensic Investigator</b></p>
            <p>A forensic investigator collaborates with the cybersecurity team to identify the offenders, determine the technique, and investigate the causes of a breach or other security issue. In order to handle physical and digital evidence appropriately in this capacity, you require substantial training and expertise. Other elements of cybersecurity forensics, like interacting with law enforcement and legal staff, must also be handled.</p>
