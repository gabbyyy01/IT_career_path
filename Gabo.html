<p style="color: black; font-size: 20px"><b>Computer support<br></br> -- > is the <i style="text-decoration: underline;">process of providing diagnostic, troubleshooting, maintenance and repair services</i> to a computer or similar device. It allows end users to seek and receive specialized computer maintenance and management services, either locally from their home/office or remotely via the Internet.</b></p>

<p style="color: black; font-size: 20px"><b>Computer support differs from technical support, which is a general term for IT-based support services.<p> It takes about two years to become an IT technical support specialist. At a minimum, an associate degree or certification coupled with on-the-job training and certification can be sufficient to get hired.</p></p></b></article>

<p style="color: black; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 50px;"><b>Computer support is provided by a computer repair/support technician or similar service provider. Assistance ranges from general operations of a computer and its related software, hardware or network issues. <p style="color: black; font-size: 20px">Local computer support resolves problems by physically operating the computer, while remote support generally requires logging into an end user's computer to analyze the query or problem.</p></p></b>

<p style="color: black; font-size: 20px"><b>Interactive computer support also may include guidance over the phone, email or chat.</p></b></article></section>

Here are some benefits of having computer support and services: 
</b></p>

<div class="desc">
<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>1. Save Money</p></b>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Outsourcing IT services will allow you to save money as they use several IT specialists. Rather than paying your in-house IT staffs with a yearly salary, you can now pay a lower fee to an MSP.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;"> What’s more, in certain arrangements, the outsourced solution manages all aspects of your computer support and services. This means hardware and software maintenance is part of the package, further reducing your expenses and saving you money in the long run.
</p></div>

<div class="desc">
<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>2. Around the Clock Support</p></b>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">While your business may run all day, your employees work on a fixed schedule. Say, for example, your business has a website that offers some form of services or purchasing, or general information about your products. Customers expect your website to be always up and running, with all the necessary information available. But, if an unexpected problem occurs, a single hour of downtime could cost thousands of dollars or more.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Having reliable third-party computer support and services can guarantee that your website stays operational 24/7. An outsourced service monitors your infrastructure and fixes any problems that arise at any time of the day.</p></div>

<div class="desc">
<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>3. Allows You to Focus on Your Business</p></b>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Operating your own business is a difficult job. You spend most of your time managing clients and employees’ expectations, building leads, and closing deals. If you don’t have enough IT staff, you also need to handle your technical infrastructure, website, and even in-house computers. This takes away your valuable time which should have been used for the core goals of your business.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Outsourcing computer support can help solve this problem. The managed service provider can manage all your IT services, giving you more time to run your business. This means you don’t need to worry anymore about coordinating with your IT team when something goes wrong. Instead, you can concentrate on more important tasks while the support services keep your computers running seamlessly.</p></div>

<div class="desc">
<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>4. Improve Customer Service</p></b>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Customers tend to have short patience when it comes to service wait times. Some customers expect to receive a response within the day while others expect a reply within an hour. Having said this, it is important that customer concerns are taken care of immediately to ensure their loyalty to your business. Improving customer support is crucial to your success. If people don’t get the support they expect, they’re likely to go to your competitors. Outsourcing computer support and services help you to quickly assist customers.</p></div>

<div class="desc">
<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>5. Scale Up Your Business</p></b>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Every entrepreneur dreams of growing his or her business. Expanding translates to success and more revenue. Yet, for you to grow your company, you also need to ramp up your IT infrastructure and to hire a large IT department. Bottom line, you need to have a big budget to make it happen.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Using third-party services allow your company to scale up without hiring more people and adding infrastructure. You can outsource ‘subscriptions’ that automatically scale while your business experiences growth.</p></b></div>
